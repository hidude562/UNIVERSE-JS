# UNIVERSE-JS
## What is this?
<p>This is a mostly complete javascript port of my TI-84 plus CE program <a href="https://github.com/hidude562/UNIVERSE-84">UNIVERSE-84</a>. In this, you can simulate orbital mechinics, <i>somewhat</i> accuracte temperature predictions, and planetary collisions.</p>

## Controls:
<p>The controls for your camera are just mouse controls. You can change the selected item on the side using the up/down arrow keys and change it with enter. Change your selected planet by using either the right/left arrow keys or you can just click on it. You can speed up time using . and slow it down using , The distance in the top left corner is the entire width of your screen. The time-warp per frame can also be seen in the top left</p>

<p>This also can run all locally so you don't need liveserver or anything</p>
